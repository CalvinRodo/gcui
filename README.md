# GCUI

This is a project to collect the bits of UI code that CDS creates into a single place, ready to be reused.

## Seeing the components

To explore the components in this project run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gcdigital-gcnumerique/gcui.git && cd gcui
yarn
yarn run storybook
```

You can then explore the components visually in a React Storybook by going to [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001/)

## Running the tests

```sh
yarn test
```
